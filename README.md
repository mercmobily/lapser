# LAPSER

Lapser is a simple script that comes from my own need to record what I do while programming.
Reasons:

* Ability to show your client what you actually did
* Abliliy to re-watch what you did during development
* Self-discipline motivated by the feeling of making a documentary about writing your software

## Nice features:

* Super light. A screencast is really expensive. Lapser isn't
* It takes one screenshot every 15 seconds. The created video has 4 frames per second. This means that for every second you watch, you watch a minute of real life and for every minute, you watch one hour
* Ability to have different independent profiles
* A nice timestamp and specific label is added to each screenshot (and therefore the movie)
* The screenshots for a timelaps are firstly archived, and then converted to a movie in MP4 format
* Dependencies are simply ffmpeg, Imagemagick and Yad

## Limitations

* Upload of videos to remote server not yet implemented
* Dual monitor is not yet managed

## Final notes

I wrote this in less than 2 days, and with very rusty knowledge of bash.
